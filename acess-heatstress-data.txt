The full dataset is publicly available via Google Cloud Storage at:

https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/heat-stress-data-public
(Google account login required to view in browser)

Alternatively, individual files can be accessed directly without login. For example, the year=1980/1980-05-01_weighted.parquet file is available at:

https://storage.googleapis.com/heat-stress-data-public/year=1980/1980-05-01_weighted.parquet

To programmatically access or bulk download the dataset using the Google Cloud SDK:

gsutil -m cp -r gs://heat-stress-data-public/year=1980 .

Repeat for other years as needed (e.g., year=1981, year=1982, etc.).

Each folder contains 153 daily .parquet files for the summer season (Mayâ€“September). Heat stress metrics (e.g., Heat Index, WBGT, UTCI) are missing when daily temperature and humidity thresholds were not met.
